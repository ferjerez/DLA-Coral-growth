 Feel free to use, as you wish. Commercial use allowed
 
 Tested in Processing 3. Libraries required: PeasyCam and ToxicLibs
 
 How to use:
 
 Run the sketch.
 
 Watch how the 'coral' growths as the 'random walkers' fall and stick in the structure.
 
 Keys:
 
 r: restart simulation
 
 i: Changes between 'growing' mode and 'Isosurface' mode
 
 In ISO mode:
 
 +/-: Rebuild the Iso surface with different tresholds.
 
 l: Apply a Laplacian smooth
 
 d: Apply a diffusion filter
 
 c: Apply a CA (cellular automaton) for smoothing and expand
 
 e: Export in STL format in stls/ folder (using timestamp for the file name)
